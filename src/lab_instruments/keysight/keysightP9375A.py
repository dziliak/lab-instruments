        ----------
        vna:
            A PyMeasure Instrument already connected via VISA.
        remote_path:
            Full path *on the VNA controller PC*, e.g.

        channel, meas:
            Channel and measurement index used by the SCPI command.

            Sets MMEM:STORe:TRACe:FORMat:SNP (RI/MA/DB/AUTO).
